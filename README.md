# Lmao Bot
2021-2022 - 380 guilds<br>

At the beginning Lmao Bot was made just for fun<br>
I started it as an exercise for learning the python programming language<br>

Then I decided to make it public, and it actually got verified!<br>

Now I decided to make it open source.<br>

# How to use it

The only thing you have to do before running the project is to change the internal variables inside the `internal.json` file, you can find it in the `Jsons` folder.

I tried to comment everything so people can understand better my code, if you have some questions, don't esitate to ask!.

# Thanks
First, I want to thank my friend [BlaseAndreone](https://blaseandreone.it/).
He was the first to know about the project, and he helped me a lot in advertising it and in improving it.<br>
<br>
Next, I want to thank everyone who supported me since the beginning.<br>
It all started with them, I would have never reached this goal without your help and support.<br>
<br>
Also, thanks to [BotGround](https://discord.gg/XeYAnZuXa5)'s staff and community.<br>
Although now it isn't as active as then, it was a great pleasure to be here and grow together.<br>
